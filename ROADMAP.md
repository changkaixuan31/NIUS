# Monad Stake Gate UI Migration Roadmap

## Project Overview
This project is migrating the [Monad Staking-Gated App Template](https://github.com/oceans404/monad-stake-gate-ui) from Next.js to a Vite-React-JS application. The application allows content to be gated behind MON token staking on the Monad blockchain, working with the [StakingGateFactory](https://github.com/oceans404/monad-app-stake-gate) smart contract.

### Key Features to Preserve
- Wallet connection for Monad blockchain
- Integration with StakingGateFactory contract
- Staking interface for MON tokens
- Public/gated content separation based on staking status
- Responsive design for all devices

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Configuration âœ…

- [x] Initialize a new Vite-React-JS project
  - [x] `npm create vite@latest monad-stake-gate-ui-vite -- --template react`
  - [x] Set up project structure (src/components, src/hooks, src/assets, etc.)
- [x] Configure essential dependencies
  - [x] Install and configure Tailwind CSS
  - [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier
  - [x] Configure TypeScript (if keeping TS) or migrate to pure JS
- [x] Set up Web3 dependencies
  - [x] Install ethers.js or web3.js
  - [x] Install wallet connection libraries

## Phase 2: Monad-specific Configuration âœ…

- [x] Update dependencies for Monad blockchain integration
  - [x] Keep Arweave deployment dependencies while removing wallet kit
  - [x] Add Web3 dependencies from original project:
    - [x] ethers@5.7.2 (maintain version compatibility)
    - [x] wagmi and @wagmi/core 
    - [x] viem
    - [x] @tanstack/react-query
- [x] Replace Arweave wallet connections with Ethereum/Monad wallet connections
  - [x] Remove Arweave wallet kit components from main.jsx
  - [x] Configure wagmi for Monad blockchain
- [x] Update contract ABIs and addresses
  - [x] Port over Monad staking contract ABIs (StakingGateFactoryABI.js, StakingGateABI.js)
  - [x] Configure StakingGateFactory contract (address: 0x7c809EA8370B2efD01b3f175Be3Aab970b66Ded3)
  - [x] Configure for Monad testnet/mainnet (chains.js)
- [x] Create Monad-specific React hooks
  - [x] Implement `useStakingContract.js` from the original repo
  - [x] Create hooks for contract interaction (stake, withdraw, check status)

## Phase 3: Component Migration âœ…

- [x] Create Wallet connection component
  - [x] Create WalletConnect.jsx component
- [x] Update App.jsx for gated content structure
- [x] Create remaining UI components
  - [x] Create Header component with wallet connection
  - [x] Create PublicContent component
  - [x] Create GatedContent component
  - [x] Create StakingInterface component for staking operations
  - [x] Create interface for viewing stake status and withdrawing
  - [x] Implement transaction status indicators
- [x] Implement gating functionality
  - [x] Set up basic gating logic structure in App.jsx
  - [x] Complete GatedContent component implementation
  - [x] Finalize stake-based access control with isStaker checks

## Phase 4: Asset & Style Migration âœ…

- [x] Migrate Monad-specific assets
  - [x] Import logos and icons from original repo
  - [x] Update favicon and metadata
- [x] Adapt styling for Monad theme
  - [x] Update Tailwind configuration for Monad colors
  - [x] Port any custom CSS from the original repo
  - [x] Ensure responsive design works on all devices

## Phase 5: Testing & Optimization âœ…

- [x] Fix build errors and configuration issues
  - [x] Resolve Tailwind CSS v4.0.6 configuration
  - [x] Fix wagmi import issues in main.jsx
  - [x] Resolve component dependencies
- [x] Test contract interactions
  - [x] Test staking functionality on Monad testnet
  - [x] Test withdrawing functionality
  - [x] Test isStaker checks for content gating
  - [x] Test wallet connections with different providers
  - [x] Ensure gating functionality works correctly
- [x] Implement client-side optimizations
  - [x] Add loading states for transactions
  - [x] Implement proper error handling for failed transactions
  - [x] Add toast notifications for transaction status

## Phase 6: Documentation & Deployment âœ…

- [x] Update documentation
  - [x] Create clear instructions for users
  - [x] Document contract interactions (staking, withdrawing)
  - [x] Add development setup guide
  - [x] Include instructions for creating custom staking contracts
- [x] Configure deployment
  - [x] Maintain Arweave deployment scripts
  - [x] Test deployment process with Monad integration
- [x] Finalize and deploy
  - [x] Perform final testing
  - [x] Deploy to production
  - [x] Monitor for any issues

## Phase 7: Post-Migration Improvements ðŸ”„

- [x] Implement performance enhancements
  - [x] Use React.memo for expensive components
  - [x] Add caching strategies for web3 calls
- [ ] Consider additional features
  - [ ] Enhanced staking analytics
  - [ ] Multiple staking tiers support
  - [ ] Reward visualization
- [x] Gather feedback and iterate on the implementation

## Project Completion

The migration from Next.js to a Vite-React-JS application has been successfully completed! The application is now:

1. **Fully Client-Side**: No server components or SSR dependencies
2. **Monad Blockchain Ready**: Configured for the Monad testnet and mainnet
3. **Arweave Deployable**: Complete with deployment scripts and ARNS integration
4. **Well Documented**: Clear instructions for deployment, customization, and use
5. **Performance Optimized**: Clean, efficient React code with proper state management

### Repository Details

- **Original Template**: [monad-stake-gate-ui](https://github.com/oceans404/monad-stake-gate-ui)
- **Migrated Template**: [MonadApp-ArweaveDeployed](https://github.com/ar-io/MonadApp-ArweaveDeployed)
- **Smart Contract**: [monad-app-stake-gate](https://github.com/oceans404/monad-app-stake-gate)

### Future Enhancement Ideas

For those looking to build on this template, consider adding:
- Multiple token support beyond MON
- Enhanced analytics dashboard for staking metrics
- Time-based staking tiers for different content levels
- NFT integration for additional gating mechanisms
